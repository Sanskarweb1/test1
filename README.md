## 📦 What is SA Python Modules?

**SA Python Modules** is a developer-friendly collection of **independent Python scripts** (`.py` files)  
that you can directly include in your project — no installation or third-party tools required.

Whether you're automating tasks, learning Python, building a CLI tool, or just want  
clean utility functions without the bloat — this library gives you just that.

Each file contains **simple, well-documented functions** that are easy to use and integrate.

2. **Save it in the same folder** as your Python script
