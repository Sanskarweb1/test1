## 📦 What is SA Python Modules?

**SA Python Modules** is a developer-friendly collection of **independent Python scripts** (`.py` files)  
that you can directly include in your project — no installation or third-party tools required.

Whether you're automating tasks, learning Python, building a CLI tool, or just want  
clean utility functions without the bloat — this library gives you just that.

Each file contains **simple, well-documented functions** that are easy to use and integrate.

---

## 🔧 How to Use

> 📁 All modules are designed to work out-of-the-box without needing pip or virtual environments.

### 💡 Steps:

1. **Download** any `.py` file from this repository (e.g., `greet.py`)
2. **Save it in the same folder** as your Python script
3. **Import it** and call its functions as needed

---

### 🧪 Example Usage

Assume you downloaded `greet.py`, which contains a function `hi(name)`.

```python
# main.py
import greet

print(greet.hi("Sanskar"))
